This is a starter project to use in an F# coding exercise working with trees and documents.

It embeds FAKE, Paket, and references to NUnit, as well as @sforkmann's lightweight FsUnit.fs file.

It also references FSharp.Formatting in order to use its Markdown parser.

Just clone the repo or download it, and get started coding and testing in F#!

To get started, just run build.cmd or ./build.sh in the folder.
