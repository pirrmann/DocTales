This is a starter project to use in an F# coding exercise working with trees and documents.

It relies on .NET core and references Expecto as a testing library/runner.

Just clone the repo or download it, and get started coding and testing in F#!

To get started, just dotnet run in the folder to run the program, or dotnet run -- tests in order to run Expecto tests.
